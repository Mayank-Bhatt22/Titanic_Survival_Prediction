# Titanic_Survival_Prediction
Built a ML model using Logistic Regression to predict Titanic passenger survival. Performed data cleaning, EDA, feature encoding, and evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and visualizations. Tools: Python, Pandas, Sklearn.
🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction
This project was completed as part of my Data Science Internship at CodSoft.
The goal was to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on passenger data.

📌 Project Objectives
Predict survival using passenger information like age, gender, class, and fare.

Perform data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualization.

Apply a classification algorithm and evaluate its performance.

🧠 What I Did
Cleaned and prepared the dataset (handled missing values, dropped irrelevant columns).

Encoded categorical features like Sex and Embarked.

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand survival patterns.

Trained a Logistic Regression model using Scikit-learn.

Evaluated the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Visualized results with Seaborn and Matplotlib.
